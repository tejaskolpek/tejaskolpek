# 👋 Hey there, I'm Tejas Kolpek!  

🚀 **Data and Cloud Engineer | Data Scientist | Security Enthusiast | Cinematographer | Speed Junkie | Hip-Hop Head | Fitness Freak**

Welcome to my digital playground! I'm a tech wizard by day, a storyteller by passion, and an adrenaline junkie at heart. Whether it's crunching data, deploying cloud solutions, or securing digital frontiers, I'm all about pushing limits. 

When I'm not immersed in tech, you'll catch me vibing to old-school hip-hop 🎤, hitting the gym for that next PR 💪, or tearing up the roads on two wheels 🏍️ and four 🚗 because speed is my therapy!
